      "description":"\"Welcome to 15th Century Iran! You are now in the Timurid period, 600 years ago. During this period, the Timurids produced exceptional works of art because they enhanced their predecessors’ works as well as experimented with pre-existing forms and traditions. (Subtelny 10) Indeed, that the Timurid period is widely regarded as the pinnacle of Islamic art and culture.\n\n The image you are looking at was made during this period, approximately 600 years ago. It is an illustration of a story from a literary work called the Shahnama. Literally, the title of the Shanama translates to \"the Book of Kings\", and it describes the epic history of Persian kings and heroes from the beginning of time to the advent of Islam. It comprises 50,000 couplets compiled by Firdawsi from oral and written accounts during the Gahnzavid rule of Central Asian and Iran. (Spuler 147) Many artists have offered various visual interpretations of the timeless tales in the book. As we examine this image in greater detail, it is thus worth keeping in mind that this is just one artist’s interpretation of a fascinating story which has enthralled readers for centuries.\""},

      "description":"\"The story that the image illustrates centres around two characters: Rustam, who is the son of Zal and a mythic hero, as well as Akwán, a cunning demon which is called a Div. Our story begins when Rustam is summoned by the king Kai Khusrau to track down and fight Akwán, which has been causing trouble for some herdsmen. Rustam finds Akwán but struggles to defeat it because it vanishes each time Rustam attempts to attack. Rustam eventually falls asleep, but Akwán lays a trap for Rustam while he sleeps. Using magic, Akwán lifts the land on which Rustam slept skyward, effectively trapping him. \n\n When Rustam wakes up, Akwán presents him with a choice: the Div says that it can either throw Rustam into the sea or on a mountain. Akwán’s evil glee is evident as it asks Rustam, \"Now, elephantine chieftain! Take thy choice/ to fall upon the mountains or the waves;/ so whither shall I fling thee far from men?\" Rustam knows that Akwán is a creature of trickery that will act contrary to what he chooses, so he chooses to be thrown on a mountain. He replies to Awkan, \"A sage of Chin hath spoken well: — ' Whoe'er is drowned his soul will never see/ Suriish in Paradise, his lot will be/ to tarry in his place in misery,/ and not to find a welcome to the sky./ Let me not therefore fall upon the ocean/ to make the fishes' maws my winding-sheet,/ but drop me on the mountains that the lions/ and tigers may behold a brave man's hands.\" As anticipated, Akwán does the opposite of what Rustam chooses and throws him into the sea instead. \n\n In the sea, Rustam has to survive treacherous waters. He draws his sword and strikes out at approaching crocodiles with his left hand and his feet while he swims towards the shore with his right hand. This specific moment of Rustam struggling towards the shore is the moment that the artist has chosen to depict on this image. Returning to the narrative, Rustam does not rest for a moment while swimming in the sea as he is determined to avoid death. He presses on until he reaches the shore. Upon arriving on the safety of the shore, Rustam gratefully praises God.\""},

      "description":"\"In the story, Rustam is evidently in deep peril after he encounters Akwán and is thrown into the sea, and the artist emphasises this sense of danger through the portrayal of the sea as vast and grey. Indeed, the dark grey of the sea connotes a sense of bleakness as Rustam’s life is at stake. Moreover, the vast landscape in this image makes Rustam appear \"smaller and less bold\". (Wright 362)  While \"sparse envisions\" are regularly featured in the Shahnama, they are usually incorporated to emphasise the character’s heroic quality. (362) However, here, artist subversively emphasises Rustam’s vulnerability is emphasised instead. Indeed, he is partially submerged in the sea, a small figure in the vast greyness which takes up the majority of the image. It is as if Rustam is being swallowed by or sucked into the sea. \n\n The fact that the dark colour of the sea blends in with the dark scales of the crocodile that Rustam is fighting also reinforces the idea that the sea is dangerous as it makes clear that it is hard for Rustam to detect the man-eating creatures around him. In fact, the camouflaging of the crocodile with the sea also makes it seem as if the sea and the crocodile are one, united in killing Rustam, who is at the mercy of both the sea’s currents and the crocodile’s fangs. By portraying the sea as vast and grey, the artist thus effectively emphasises to the reader that Rustam is in grave danger.\""},

      "description":"\"On the other hand, the bright golden-yellow colour of Rustam’s armour stands out in contrast to his dark surroundings and connotes his bravery and hopefulness. The fact that his armour is the only item in the image that has a bright colour suggests that Rustam remains courageous and hopeful in spite of the danger and grimness that he is surrounded by. It is as if Rustam is the only ray of light in a place of utter darkness. Indeed, the golden-yellow colour of his armour asserts that the value of Rustam’s valour, that he is a worthy warrior, a literal a knight in shining armour. Thus, it seems that the artist is trying to emphasise positive traits of Rustam as a knight by choosing to depict the specific moment in which Rustam, against all odds, remains courageous, fights to stay alive and return to shore. Rustam is unmistakably the hero.\""},

      "description":"\"The artist’s desire to portray Rustam in a positive light is further augmented by his depiction of Rustam as a spiritual man, as evinced in his choice to depict Rustam wearing a turban helmet. We can tell that the helmet that Rustam wears is a turban helmet because his helmet has the signature of a turban helmet. This helmet originates from Ottoman Turkey and allows for the individual to wear a headcloth under the helmet. It is associated with religiosity and spirituality because it often has arabesques or inscriptions engraved on it. (Robinson 77) The turban helmet thus seems like it is a physical manifestation of Rustam’s devotion to God. In Firdawsi’s text, Rustam’s religiosity is evinced in how he immediately gives his \"thanks to God, the giver of all Good\" after he survives the trap that Akwán had laid for him. The artist thus seems to stress Rustam’s spirituality through the depiction of the turban helmet. It would seem, then, that Rustam survives because God answers his prayers and allows him to swim safely to the shore. \n\n Rustam’s spirituality is especially significant when understood in the context of the allegorical significance behind the story of Rustam’s fight with Akwán. This story could be read as an allegory which emphasises man's free choice to choose between divine order and diabolic disorder. While Rustam is presented as a hero, he actually occupies an ambiguous position because of his demonic ancestry. Meanwhile, Akwán is a distinct demonic figure, a Div which represents an evil man who opposes God’s will and transgresses the boundaries of divine order. Rustam’s battle with Akwán is thus symbolic of his confrontation of the demonic part of his psyche and his choice to embrace God. Hence, by emphasising Rustam’s spirituality through the turban helmet, the artist draws attention to one of the main messages of the story: that man’s free will gives each man the choice to either uphold God’s order or cause demonic mayhem.\""},

      "description":"\"Finally, there is one last detail in this image that we have not discussed. Did you notice Akwán hiding behind some plants towards the left of the image? I would not fault you if you did not! After all, Rustam’s fight with the crocodile takes place towards the middle of the page under the 4 columns of text while Akwán lurks in the far margin, shrouded behind plants which are themselves partly beneath the text on the folio; this effectively conveys the sinister nature of Akwán to the reader as the creature appears to be lurking just out of sight. The fact that Akwán is hiding far in the background means that it takes the reader some time to register Akwán’s presence, so we are caught off guard when we realise that Akwán is watching Rustam from afar. Furthermore, the reader can infer that Rustam is also unaware that he is being watched because Rustam is occupied with his fight with the crocodile in the sea. Consequently, we are alarmed by Akwán’s hidden presence as we register the threat that Akwán poses to the unprepared and unassuming Rustam. The choice to portray Akwán as a creature hiding in the periphery thus effectively connotes its sinister nature.\""},

      "description":"\"Hopefully, you have realised that the artist has put in a lot of effort to bring the text to life through his illustration and interpretation of the text. The many details in the image allow us to better appreciate the themes of the story and visualise the narrative. For instance, through the image, we glimpse the danger that Rustam is in as he struggles in the dark, vast sea. Nonetheless, his bright armour connotes his heroic determination to reach the shore and his turban helmet connotes his spirituality, so we have the faith that God will watch over him and help him to reach the shore. The presentation of Akwán hiding in the periphery not only gives us a visual representation of how the Div could look like but also makes us aware of his sinister nature. The illustration thus clearly helps to illuminate the text. In the future, when you next flip open a book. take a good look at illustrations – you might be surprised by how much better you can appreciate the story after looking at the images!"},
